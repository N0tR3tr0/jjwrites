First, let us define a role model. If you have someone who looks up to you, you're a role model. If any of your acts influence someone and their acts, you're a role model. If you respect someone very much, for any of their qualities, they're now a role model for you. The idea is simple. Let's not get into the intricacies of the definition.

Now how do you know there's a problem. Stop for a minute and think. How often have you seen your dad cry?

The answer's for most people is zero.
We're brought up in such a patriarchal society, fathers are the default and probably the first role model for kids. They have to be a role model.

Now, this is foreseen and widely acceptable. When you decide to have a child, you decide to act as and take upon the responsibility of being the role model.

Similarly, when you're signing up to be a role model, you're aware of it. You put yourself on the high ground. The most common example of this signing up is - training the younger generation. When you come in contact with someone who's years younger, you siphon off wisdom. and there it is. You're setting up the ground for being the role model. You siphon off enough over time, and you hold such high place in their palace of respect, you're like that idol who always knows what to do. They look up to you in problems, they subconsciously mimic your acts in dire circumstances.

The problem comes when you're in valleys of your positivity. When you're confused; when you're not naturally siphoning off positivity. That's when you act tough, try to maintain the torch high for the little guy.

What's the problem with being down for some time. It's not like the little guy is just looking up to me to give meaning and purpose to his life. It's not like my bad actions will affect his life. It's my life ya. Ya?

You bet.

The problem is - he's watching you. How you deal with your shit can very well affect how he deals with his shit when the time comes. If I'm not clear enough, a simple google search on `the problem with being a role model` will tell you just how much role models can affect the lives of those who look up to them. You should probably go google and read up the top 5-7 articles. Most focus on parenthood, but the context can be easily extended to general life.

Point being, you're responsible now. You have to be the torch.
And its easy most days, because if you weren't the torch by default, you wouldn't have become a role model in the little guy's eyes. But on some days, when the torch isn't bright, it's your responsibility to still brighten up his day. It's not a choice now.
Classic - The sun shines regardless of his mood.

Now, all of this stays at an acceptable level when the feeling is mutual. The little guy looking up to you for being a role model, and you accepting the fact that you're his role model. Things work fine in this state.

It gets fuzzier when you become a role model in the eyes of someone, and you're not just yet ready to accept that responsibility.

If someone is down, he needs friends to listen to his problems, his worries. To share his negativity. To listen to him. To advise him. To understand his human nature and tendencies. He needs someone he can entrust his thoughts with, someone who'd not break with the negativity. Someone's who's close enough to stay and far enough to not burn under the fire-spitting torch. He does not need disciples to feed off his negativity.

When you become a role model for someone, you're in a position where you can't share your problems with them. You simply do not want to.

It might be ideal to be open and share your thoughts with the little guy, but it is not what happens in real life. Not often enough.

In the father figure context, even if he is not your role model, in his eyes, in the eyes of the patriarchal society, he is supposed to be your role model, supposed to be strong, and that is why, he cannot share his problems with you, even if you want to listen to them.

It's like running a marathon with a fire torch, you gotta keep it high, anytime it lowers, it can burn the carpet, can cause harm to the other runners.

Now because many role models do not understand this fact, they not only lower the torch, they set everything on the way to fire, just to let it all out. In the process, affecting many lives, shaping many individuals.

This is probably a problem very much faced by celebrities or globally influential people. They become role models long before they realize and the depth to which they affect certain individuals is unimaginable. Tough ya.

Self-Realization is the first step of change.
We have to understand the fact that our role models are human beings as well. They've got their lows. They've got a life similar to yours.

All you can do is learn from the positivity they siphon off, and not embrace the negativity that comes with being a human.
