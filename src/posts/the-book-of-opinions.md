At the dawn of time, there were two friends. H & M. 

When they were kids they were best friends. They would play together, eat together, live together, and grow together. Because this was the dawn of time, they would eat grass and meat alike, they would eat anything and everything. 

Then hit puberty. The growth accelerated. They began thinking about the world around them in the ways they had never thought of before. 

They decided to travel. They wanted some time in solitude. So, H goes to the farthest right corner of the visible land. M goes to the farthest left.

They would think about the world, about the coming generations and about life itself. Both tested the limits of their vessels. They would not eat for days at a time. Best to say, they found peace in what they were doing.

Years passed. They became wiser.  They had found themselves, and understood the type of person they had become.

Then one day, they got reminded of each other. They decided to meet. They both started travelling and met halfway.

They decided to settle down for a few days in a nearby village, excited to tell each other of their interesting journey all these years. As they lived together, they saw how apart they have grown.
 
H was now a vegetarian because where he lived he had trees. He had forests. Countless fruits, lots of greenery, birds, animals, a lot of them.
M however, had seen the worst of it. In a desert with no large trees, no fruits, the only way to be alive was to eat other animals. And over the years, he had become habitual of eating meat.

After living for so many years in solitude, M had learned to survive on anything. If offered, he would also eat vegetables. His struggles had taught him to survive at all costs. But he sure preferred meat.
H, on the other hand, was so rigid and bound to his habits and beliefs, he would choose to die than to eat meat.
It's hard to say who had become a better man, a wiser man. 

Best to say, they were the best for themselves.

M would often become jealous looking at how many people gathered near H, listening to all of his stories of many many animals. H taught them how to domesticate animals. 
M always thought of survival. Domesticate a camel, sure. Then eat him when necessary. 

H, he could not even digest the three people who gathered around M. He was very rigid and did not approve of M.

Needless to say, they were poles apart in a lot of things.

After a few days passed, they decided to go back to their places. So they bid a bittersweet goodbye and went to their places.

Their lives were very different.

H's life was good. He lived in a hut near a forest. The forest gave him fruits, vegetables, rains. Now because he was thankful, he'd thank for everything. If it rained, he thanked the clouds. If he found a new grain in the forest, he'd thank the soil. He'd thank the tools that he used to build his house. He had a lot of things, a lot of superior powers he thanked.  

Isn't that how it should be? A human who's thankful for the world he lives in.

M's life was survival. He had learned the ultimate truth. Survival triumphs. If he survived a storm, he'd feel good about his win. He felt his status rising. His wisdom rising. Now the storms and the emptiness didn't teach him to be polite. He was used to killing animals for his lunch. It taught him to survive.

Isn't that how it should be? Humans are animals after all. and we've reached here by surviving. Survival is the ultimate instinct.

Days passed. Years passed. They grew wiser, more rigid, more suited for their environments, more apart. 

The word of their wisdom spread. Followers started rolling. Within a few months, they had followers, devotees.

It was time to start sharing their wisdom. They had gathered enough. It was time to give. They started setting up villages. They'd offer their wisdom. The wisdom of the earth, the sky, the forest, the desert, and survival. 

People loved this, some even settled near them so they could absorb all that wisdom. This went on for some time. 

Once they were old, they decide to pass on their wisdom. They decided to write it all down, so their followers, their disciples could learn what they had gathered over the years.

Both of them then began writing down their books. They began writing down their opinions. How they saw the world, what they learned from it. They began writing down their book of opinions.

H had seen more variety in life forms. He was thankful for each of the infinite things he saw. So he wrote several books, documenting his knowledge of the forest, his wisdom of life mixed with his own opinions, which were most certainly indistinguishable from facts, for him. 

M had only known one truth all this life. So he wrote one book. The book of survival. 

The books were written in cryptic languages. The language they developed themselves over time. Simple beings couldn't comprehend the symbols.

Over time, they realized their time is limited, and they'd soon die of old age. They then started teaching their followers how to read their cryptic books. This sense of exclusiveness boomed the growth of followers. They now had tanglible exclusive material.

H had a certain philosophy that the wisdom could only be absorbed when light and darkness meets at horizon. He would teach from his books every morning, every evening. Some books some days, others other days. It was a carefully devised annual routine to read through all the books.

M would teach from his book multiple times a day. Before they'd go hunting, he'd remind his followers of the survival guide, and ask them to recite it, so they'd remember.

Years passed. H & M were no longer walked the earth.
Hundreds now gathered and settled in villages, tribes. Some of them shifted their priorities and devoted their entire lives to studying those books. Some of them mastered the books. 
These new book masters suddely gained a higher status in the settlements. They suddenly knew better, they were now close to H and M. They rose to power. Masses started following them, listening to them. This led to heirarchies within over time.

The followers spread, claimed their lands, their territories. People settled down, had families. They would preach the holy books to their kids, their descendents.

Fast forward a few hundred years. The descendents of H & M now fight for power. Disregard the teachings of the other side. And keep the teachings of their ancient books over their own lives, over their own learnings. Neither of the sides realizes what they had become.

That's pretty much the story.

H & M were best friends at a time, more like brothers. All they had done is they chose different lives, as they should have. They had just gone different ways, lived differently, learned different truths. What they learned, they wrote down. What they lived, what they experienced became their opinions. opinions got mixed with wisdom, became indistinguishable. And over time spread to thousands of followers, who are now unable to distinguish, the truth from the opinion. 

All they do now, is blindly follow and fight over the truth of the book of opinions.
