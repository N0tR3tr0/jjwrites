It's been four months since I set up this blog and I haven't published a single post in all this time. Why did this happen?

The short answer is pretty simple - It's hard to write daily.

However, I don't think that's been the primary reason for my lack of posts. Four months is enough time to publish a post if you're motivated. And yet, even after all that motivation, it didn't happen.

I started with two different blogs in July. Now July was a hectic time. I had other important things to attend to. So even if I cut some slack to July. I still had a good three month time to start writing.

For the tech blog, I did start writing. But the article I was writing turned out to be a long one, I spent a week writing it down, in bits and pieces, and it still wasn't complete. After that, I lost most of my motivation to continue with it. It still hasn't been published. And it was my first actual article.
This gives a good insight into the tech domain articles.

> Write your technical posts quick. Finish them in atmost two days.

A second reason was I was being too selective with my topics. I need to understand that these are hobby blogs and if I get too selective about the topics I'll end up writing nothing, ultimately defeating the purpose.

> If you have an idea, however small, write it's blog post soon, or it'll fade away in the dilemma of importance.

This probably covers a major chunk of the reasons why the tech blog didn't have a lot of posts.

Coming back to this very blog,

It's not that I have a lack of ideas. I note down any idea as soon as it hits me. I even wrote a few drafts, but not even one could finish. Some reasons are the same as above.

I took too much time to write them down. I realized the idea has its impact only for a few hours. If I write it down within that duration, it comes down nice, or it just fades away.

> Write the personal blog posts in one day.

The second reason was a little unexpected. I realized I've never actually publically blogged personal thoughts. There is a certain level of reservation in that. And I'm an introvert when it comes to personal thoughts, always keeping them to myself, so the idea of posting it out is a little scary. I don't want to give off too much. I only want to post good stuff, again being selective. This is probably the first challenge I'll have to overcome. And a lot of the content will probably be junk, but I can always highlight the good ones. So, let there be junk. Lol.

And even after all these arguments I still want to write, because it's probably the best way to remember and look back at these thoughts. Without this documentation, I'll just forget them, forget the hard work, forget the determination, forget the lessons. And one who does not know the history is condemned to repeat it.

If you think I'm exaggerating my forgetfulness, think again.

Coincidently, this post is being written exactly 4 months after the Hello world. 9th June to 9th October 2019. But then again, there are no coincidences.

I'll start publishing my drafts soon and write down the things I've always wanted to write. This is probably the best time to do it. To get into the habit of writing.

Peace.
