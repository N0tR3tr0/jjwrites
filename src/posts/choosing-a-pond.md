Here we're talking about the classic dilemma - Whether to be a big fish in a small pond, or to be a small fish in a big pond. 

Usually what this means is, whether you want to be surrounded by group of smart people where you're not the smartest one aka small fish in a big pond or do you want to be the smartest one in the room aka big fish in a small pond. Applications can vary, from work life to social life, and probably personal life as well.

The standard answer is - you should always strive to be a small fish in a big pond. No one ever grew by being the smartest person in the room. By choosing this, you'll always push yourself to be better, you'll aim higher, etc, etc. Your growth curve would be much better. If you choose otherwise, the small pool is your world. You live in your own bubble, limiting yourself, and underutilizing your growth potential. 

Atleast that's what has been my goto answer for several years. Why would anyone want to live as a self fulfilling prophecy, never truly challenging oneself. 

If the answer is so straightforward, why is this still a dilemma. 

-----------

The fundamental question is - why do we want to grow? 

Pause for a minute, and ask yourself. Why do you want to grow? What is it that you want that compells you to grow? Or is growth your only objective, and you seek growth for the sake of growth, and want to accomplish nothing by means of this growth?

Think of it this way,

If you already have a lot of money, why do you want to have more?
If you already have some knowledge, why do you want to have more?

Growth for the sake of growth sounds alluring. That's probably the ideal we are chasing. But let's walk on the mortal path for a bit. IMHO, people want to grow so that their knowledge, their money, their growth can be helpful in the time of need. When you face a challenge, you want to feel powerful enough to overcome that challenge. 

You go to the gym? Why?
To build muscle, so you could dominate a fight.
To build fitness, so you could overcome the challenge of health problems.
To build endurance, so you could use it when you need it.

Every challenge demands a level of growth. And we want to keep growing to overcome all those challenges that await us. We keep pushing ourselves all our life. We keep preparing ourselves for the challenges that may come. We want to be ready when it comes.

This sounds rudimentary and may or may not align with your answer as to why do you want to grow. That's not the point.

The point is, we are so obsessive over growth, we keep pushing and pushing. Not stopping for a moment to think about why are we running and what is it we want to accomplish by this growth. 

Ask yourself, what is it you want to accomplish by the hustle you're doing to grow yourself. 
What is it that you're aiming to achieve by being a small fish in a big pond.

-----------

Confidence is another way to feel powerful. Probably the most effective way. IMO, confidence single handedly can improve the quality of your life. It makes you feel better, makes your feel great, makes you feel invincible. 

Whether or not you are invincible is another matter. We have to understand that we live in our mini world. And our actions are guided by what we feel. So feeling invincible is much more important that being invincible. That works almost like a placebo. Feeling well prepared is more important, than objectively measuring your preparation. 

One must strive for confidence. It changes your life, for the better. Confidence in one area of life, naturally seeps into other areas over time, and improves your overall quality of life. More Confidence allows you to take more risks. More risks often result in more rewards, which in turn boost your confidence. It sounds simplistic. I've found it to be transformational. 

So if the goal is to improve your quality of life, if the goal is to be more confident, don't you think living in that small pond as a big fish automatically boosts your confidence. Isn't that a good enough reason to live in your own mini world.

This does not mean that confidence cannot be achieved in the big pond. It simply means, the probability of individuals gaining confidence is more in the small pond.

-----------

Does that mean the big fish in the small pond has a better quality of life in comparison to that small fish who is in continuous pursuit of growth, almost compulsively at times, and more often than not, not knowing the reason of their continuous attempt at growth.

That's something to think about. 

I believe the point is to have contentment. If living a slow life gives you contentment, so be it. You don't have to live in the big pond if you don't want to.
