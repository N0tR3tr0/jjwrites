# Siddhartha

> Book completed 30th May, 2020

Siddhartha is definitely a good book. 

Here are my takeaways -

1. When we read a book, we do it to understand the meaning. we do not discard the symbols by saying it's an illusion. Similarly, when we look at the world, we should not discard the moh maya saying it's an illusion. There's an inherent meaning to it that teaches us about life.

2. To pursue spirituality, one need not leave the earthly possessions behind and be away from his social responsibilities. Spirituality lives within us, and whatever we want to do can be done from within the world.

3. To think, To wait, To fast - looks like the golden rules of life. To listen - sounds like the ultimate rule of life. We can learn so much by listening.

4. By following the golden rules, we can enable ourselves to behave in the same way a stone behaves when it is thrown into the sea. It reaches the base of the sea effortlessly. Similarly, if we set our goal to be as base of the sea, we can fall through the mortal life and its obstacles to reach to the goal. All we need to do is not allow things that resist our goal to enter our soul. And we would ultimately reach our goal effortlessly.

5. Life is a full circle. Everything comes back.

### Food for thought

1. Wisdom cannot be passed on. It must be earned and experienced. We can only pass down knowledge.
And that is why every guru trying to teach the wisdom of spirituality is in vain. One has to experience his spirituality himself. Listening to preachers won't give your spiritual self any wisdom.
