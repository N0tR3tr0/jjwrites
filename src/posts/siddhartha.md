The book is a good read. I personally liked it. It's a quick read, and delivers good value compared to the reading time. The book is about a brahman boy who searches for meaning of life. He goes on a journey where he lives several different lives, understanding the facets of each life. He also meets Gautam Buddha along the way.

The book is often confused to be a life journey of gautam buddha because of the similarity in names. Siddhartha Gautama was gautam buddh's real name. The book subtly draws a parallel where a boy living in the same era as buddha goes on a different path to peace.

Here are some of my takeaways. The book is filled with such takeaways -

1. When we read a book, we do it to understand the meaning. we do not discard the symbols by saying it's an illusion. Similarly, when we look at the world, we should not discard the moh maya saying it's an illusion. There's an inherent meaning to it that teaches us about life.

2. To pursue spirituality, one need not leave the earthly possessions behind and be away from his social responsibilities. Spirituality lives within us, and whatever we want to do can be done from within the world.

3. To think, To wait, To fast - are the golden rules of life. Listening more so. We can learn so much by listening. 

4. By following the golden rules, we can enable ourselves to behave in the same way a stone behaves when it is thrown into the sea. It reaches the base of the sea effortlessly. Similarly, if we set our goal to be as base of the sea, we can fall through the mortal life, its distraction and its obstacles to reach to the goal. All we need to do is not allow things that resist our goal to enter our soul. And we would ultimately reach our goal effortlessly.

5. Wisdom cannot be passed on. It must be earned and experienced. We can only pass down knowledge. And that is why every guru trying to teach the wisdom of spirituality is vain. One has to experience his spirituality himself. Listening to preachers won't give your spiritual self any wisdom.

6. Life is a full circle. Everything comes back.
