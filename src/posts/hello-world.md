Hello there, howdy?

I've been trying to set up a blog for a long time now. Almost 5 years. Even tried setting up a collaborative blog with friends. But most of them never even got started. We would make id's, set up accounts, perfectly ready to go. Even wrote hello world posts, but most of them never got their second post. Reasons vary.

Then about 2 years ago, I started a private Wordpress blog, wrote in it more than a dozen times, just to vent out my thoughts, and soon after forgot about it. Recently, it surfaced, and I read some of my old posts, and surprisingly, it made me happy. I felt pretty motivated. It's a nice feeling to look back to yourself, and see how naive, how thoughtful, how worried you were, and then see how far you've come.

Long story short, this is another attempt to write, just this time, it's public. Why write? It's for the clarity of thought. Writing it down, word by word gives your thoughts a definitive structure, and probably save it for a re-read in the future.

Why are there two j's in the name? Well, j-writes, Jatin-writes were too clinical, so I took a little help from alliteration. And I was too lazy to think of a clever name.

The content here would mostly be thoughts, opinions, and stories. Alright then, let's get writing.

JJ Writes Now.
Peace.
