The speedometer read 290 million metres per second.
That was 2 days ago.

When he woke up this morning, he knew that the next time he runs, he would touch the speed of light. Soon, he would be even faster. And when he becomes the first man to cross the light barrier, he would know success. He would have achieved his dream.

Today, he started running. He quickly got to his previous record. He felt this energy in his legs, he exerted a force like never before, a lightning aura wrapped his body, he was at the brink of crossing the light barrier.

He wanted to enjoy this moment, he wanted to see himself crossing it. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, it distracted him, and he suddenly started losing speed. He was no longer fast enough. He called it a day, and went back to rest.

He realised what was happening. All we ever wanted to do was run. So he ran, without thought, without mind. And now his own mind was slowing him down. He knew he could achieve the speed he needed, but he wouldn't be able to feel it, he wouldn't be able to remember how he felt at that moment.

His meta thinking was slowing him down.

He could do one of the two things.
Either, just run blindly into success, and forget about everything else,
or to meta think about the moment he's about to achieve and in doing so, slow himself down.

He was faced with a dilemma. The dilemma between the two sides.

The first one -

Fulfilling his goals first, and then cherishing how far he's come. Because what good is meta thinking if you're still far from the goal.

And the second one -

Being aware of the path he's taking. Because what good is success if he can't feel himself going towards it. Meta thinking about this will give him a long lasting memory, not only of the success, but the heights he was willing to get that. How motivated, how passionate he was when he had not achieved his only goal.

What would you choose?
