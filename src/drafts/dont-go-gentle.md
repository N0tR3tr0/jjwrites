Do not go gentle into that good night,
<br>
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
<br>
Because their words had forked no lightning they
<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
<br>
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
<br>
And learn, too late, they grieve it on its way,
<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
<br>
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
<br>
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.
<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
